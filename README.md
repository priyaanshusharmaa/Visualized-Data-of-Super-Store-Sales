# Visualized-Data-of-Super-Store-Sales

**Summary -**
Use a sales dataset like Superstore.csv in Power BI.

Explore the data to find key insights (e.g., top products, best/worst regions).

Choose the right charts (bar, line, area, etc.) to present each insight clearly.

Avoid clutterâ€”keep visuals clean and easy to read.

Add short notes, labels, or tooltips to explain what the chart is showing.
